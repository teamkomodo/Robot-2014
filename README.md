# Fluffy code

### How do I use it?

-Download and install the old FRC toolchain from [here](https://usfirst.collab.net/sf/wiki/do/viewPage/projects.thunder_crio_c_tools/wiki/HomePage?showDetails=false)

-Download and install eclipse luna

-Download and install an old version of JDK (I use 8u112 and have not had an issue)

-Open up eclipse and select help -> install new software

-Set the name to Thunder cRIO Tools and the location to http://penfieldrobotics.com/criotools/stable

-Spam the ok button untill it installs

-Set your team number in Window -> Preferences -> Thunder cRIO Tools

-Make a new project in File -> New -> C++ Project -> Shared Library -> FRC cRIO Binary

-Clone in this repo to wherever you made your new project and refresh eclipse

-locate a 2014 version of driver station from the depths of the internet

-The driver station wont boot unless you install some ni stuff so find LVRTE2013std_downloader.exe somewhere (idk i just copied the name)

-Happy working robit =)
